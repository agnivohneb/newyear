# The New Year Clock

![Logo](images/logo.jpg)

This is a countdown project I made about 10 years ago. I uploaded it to GitHub 3 years ago to archive the old project ([see version 1.0](https://github.com/benhovinga/newyear/tree/1.0)). Just recently I started to do Web Development again and thought I would look over this project and update it to more modern standards while still keeping it simple.
